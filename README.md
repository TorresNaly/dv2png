# image_analysis
Repository to automatically download and visualize deltavision files stored in the NAS.  This repository uses PySMB to access and transfer data between Network-attached storage (NAS) and a local or a remote server (Alpine-HPC). Microscope images are then organized in subdirectories ready for creating a report or image analysis.
