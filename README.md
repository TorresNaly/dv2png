# DV to png converter
Repository to automatically download and organize deltavision images stored in the NAS.  This repository uses PySMB to access and transfer data between Network-attached storage (NAS) and a local or a remote server (Alpine-HPC). Microscope images are then organized in subdirectories for image analysis (non_decolvoved) or for experiment report/display (deconvolved).
